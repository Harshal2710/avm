# Setting up your computer

There are multiple ways in which we can set up your computer to code in python. But the few of the  recommended ways is to use Jupyter notebook or VS code. Other options include IDLE the pythons built in editor, Atom or PyCharm.

The reason we want to use an editor is to use the extensive features provided by them which include code auto completion, easy to run and see output and many more..
